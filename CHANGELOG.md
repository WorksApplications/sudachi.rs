# [0.6.4](https://github.com/WorksApplications/sudachi.rs/releases/tag/v0.6.3) (2022-06-16)

## Highlights

* Remove Python 3.6 support which reached end-of-life status on [2021-12-23](https://endoflife.date/python)
* OOV handler plugins support user-defined POS, [similar to Java version](https://github.com/WorksApplications/Sudachi/releases/tag/v0.6.0)
* Added Regex OOV handler

## Regex OOV Handler

* For details, see [Java version changelog](https://github.com/WorksApplications/Sudachi/releases/tag/v0.6.0)
* In Rust/Python Regexes do not support backtracking and backreferences
* `maxLength` setting defines maximum length in unicode codepoints, not in utf-8 bytes as in Java (will be changed to codepoints later)

# [0.6.3](https://github.com/WorksApplications/sudachi.rs/releases/tag/v0.6.3) (2022-02-10)

## Highlights

* Fixed path resolution algorithm for resources. They are now resolved in the following order (first existing file wins):
  1. Absolute paths stay as they are
  2. Relative to "path" value of the config file
  3. Relative to "resource_dir" parameter of the config object during creation
     * For SudachiPy it is the parameter of `Dictionary` constructor
  4. Relative to the location of the configuration file
  5. Relative to the current directory

## Python

* `Dictionary` now has `__repr__()` function which displays absolute paths to dictionaries in use.
* `Dictionary` now has `pos_of()` function which returns a POS tuple for a given POS id.
* `PosMatcher` supports set operations
  * union (`m1 | m2`)
  * intersection (`m1 & m2`)
  * difference (`m1 - m2`)
  * negation (`~m1`)

# [0.6.2](https://github.com/WorksApplications/sudachi.rs/releases/tag/v0.6.2) (2021-12-09)

## Fixes

* Fix analysis differences with 0.5.4

# [0.6.1](https://github.com/WorksApplications/sudachi.rs/releases/tag/v0.6.1) (2021-12-08)

## Highlights
* Added Fuzzing (see `sudachi-fuzz` subdirectory), Sudachi.rs seems to be pretty robust towards arbitrary inputs (no crashes and panics)
  * Issues like https://github.com/WorksApplications/sudachi.rs/issues/182 should never occur more
* ~5% analysis speed improvement over 0.6.0
* Added support for Unicode combining symbols, now Sudachi.rs/py should be much better with emoji (üéÖüèæ) and more complex Unicode (ƒ∞stanbul)

## Rust
* Added partial dictionary read functionality, it is now possible to skip reading certain fields if they are not needed
* Improved startup times, especially for debug builds

## Python
* See [Python changelog](./python/CHANGELOG.md)

# [0.6.0](https://github.com/WorksApplications/sudachi.rs/releases/tag/v0.6.0) (2021-11-11)
## Highlights
* Full feature parity with Java version
* ~15% analysis speed improvement over 0.6.0-rc1

## Rust
* Added dictionary build functionality
  * https://github.com/WorksApplications/sudachi.rs/pull/143
* Added an option to perform analysis without sentence splitting
  * Use it with `--split-sentences=no`

## Python
* Added bindings for dictionary build (undocumented and not supported as API).
  * See https://github.com/WorksApplications/sudachi.rs/issues/157
* `sudachipy build` and `sudachipy ubuild` should work once more
  * Report on build times and dictionary part sizes can differ from the original SudachiPy


# [0.6.0-rc1](https://github.com/WorksApplications/sudachi.rs/releases/tag/v0.6.0-rc1) (2021-10-26)
## Highlights

* First release of Sudachi.rs
* SudachiPy compatible Python bindings
* ~30x speed improvement over original SudachiPy
* Dictionary build mode will be done before 0.6.0 final (See #13)

## Rust

* Analysis: feature parity with Python and Java version
* Dictionary build is not supported in rc1
* ~2x faster than Java version (with sentence splitting)
* No public API at the moment (contact us if you want to use Rust version directly, internals will significantly change and names are not finalized)

## Python

* Mostly compatible with SudachiPy 0.5.4
* We provide binary wheels for popular platforms
* ~30x faster than 0.5.4
* IgnoreYomigana input text plugin is now supported (and enabled by default)
* We provide [binary wheels for convenience (and additional speed on Linux)](https://worksapplications.github.io/sudachi.rs/python/wheels.html)

## Known Issues

* List of deprecated SudachiPy API:
    * `MorphemeList.empty(dict: Dictionary)`
        * This also needs a dictionary as an argument.
    * `Morpheme.split(mode: SplitMode)`
    * `Morpheme.get_word_info()`
    * Most of instance attributes are not exported: e.g. `Dictionary.grammar`, `Dictionary.lexicon`.
        * See [API reference page](https://worksapplications.github.io/sudachi.rs/python/) for supported APIs.
* Dictionary Build is not supported: `sudachipy build` and `sudachipy ubuild` will not work, please use 0.5.3 in another virtual environment for the time being until the feature is implemented: #13
